      <h1>Acknowledging Country</h1>

      <p>
        This website is hosted and maintained in on unceded Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung Country. 
        Avantwhatever.net caretakers are settlers here, listening and learning from local people and place. We pay our respects and gratitude to Wurundjeri Elders past and present, and promise to tread lightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We extend these respects and promises to those other First Nations peoples and communities, on whose land, sea and air the material pathways that allow our digital connectivity are embedded.
