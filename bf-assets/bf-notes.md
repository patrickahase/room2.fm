# Brainstorming possibilities 
- Tides (Narrm/Port Phillip Bay)
- Weather 
    > Current temp/conditions
    > Forecast 
- Moon phases (Suncalc) 
- Sunrise/sunset and other time values 
- Countdown to next composition? 

# Notes
- 29/08/22 beginning of async 
- 25/09/22 live event(s?) begin
- Beginning of 'Spring', time of transition and warming up 
- New moon: 27 Aug + 26 Sep; the async streams cover *almost* a full moon cycle from new moon to new moon
- Location settings to Arts House GPS? (eg. for weather info, sunrise/set info)
- Relational to the audience 
- Procedural values could drive some of the visuals 
- approx 4 weeks of async web stuff leading up to the event. 6-8 sounds/tracks will be programmed cyclically and run for 24ish hour periods. 
- Raag is writing the prompts 
- Tracks changing over at sunrise?
