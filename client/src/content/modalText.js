  This website was created and is maintained on the unceded territory of the Wurundjeri People of the Eastern Kulin Nation, 
  the Traditional Custodians of the land. We recognise their ongoing legacy of connection to land, waters and culture 
  and pay respect to their Elders past and present. We extend this respect to all other First Nations peoples 
  of this continent, whose stolen land the material pathways that allow our digital connectivity are built upon.

    room2.fm seeks to create a digital space for collective reflection, sharing, and vulnerability. During the last lockdown 
    season we were lucky to have a range of guest artists who helped facilitate this by contributing sounds, texts and visuals 
    to the space, which was brought together by the active participation in the responses and in the chat by those attending 
    the space on each given weekly event.

    There is no right or wrong way for you to listen, respond to, or feel a piece of music or sound. We encourage you to 
    trust your ears and intuition and respond sincerely and in whatever way feels true to your experience.

    You can share your response to the music, prompts and visuals in a number of ways.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    Periodically, text prompts will come up in the lower middle of the screen. Underneath the prompts you can select to respond 
    via either writing or drawing depending on what you think is most appropriate. Once you are happy with your response you can 
    click the ‘submit response’ button to share it with others. Above the ‘submit response’ button, you can select the colour palette 
    you will be able to draw responses with, along with options to change the brush size, use an eraser and undo or redo additions to 
    your drawing. 
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    Your responses to these prompts will be completely anonymised and not attributable to you in any way, however during this 
    demonstration we will be capturing a screen recording of the experience.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    You can also use the chat box on the right of the screen to directly speak to others participating. Select a username and 
    click ‘Join Room’ to engage. Be yourself, be someone else, be whomever you want to be!
