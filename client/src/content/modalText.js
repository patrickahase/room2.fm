  This website was created and is maintained on the unceded territory of the Wurundjeri People of the Eastern Kulin Nation, 
  the Traditional Custodians of the land. We recognise their ongoing legacy of connection to land, waters and culture 
  and pay respect to their Elders past and present. We extend this respect to all other First Nations peoples 
  of this continent, whose stolen land the material pathways that allow our digital connectivity are built upon.

    room2.fm is a digital space for collective reflection, sharing, and vulnerability. For four weeks across the course 
    of <a href="https://bleedonline.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BLEED</a> room2 will be presenting nine different 
    cycles of music and sound accompanied by a reflective writen prompt and generative graphics.
  </span>
  <br />  
  <br />
  <span>
    While listening to the audio you will be asked to respond to the prompt through either writing or drawing before anonymously 
    submitting it to the room2 server. Once you've shared your own response you will be able to see the previous responses of other
    users.
  </span>
  <br />  
  <br />
  <span>
    There is no right or wrong way for you to listen, respond to, or feel a piece of music or sound. We encourage you to 
    trust your ears and intuition and respond sincerely and in whatever way feels true to your experience.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    While anonymous the responses will be collected as part of a digital archive which will be online for a longer period than 
    the four weeks of BLEED. The only information we store is the response itself and the time it was submitted. If you would 
    like to remove your personal response from the archive please contact us.

    For four weeks across the course of BLEED, room2 will offer a suite of digital spaces to encourage reflection and encounter works to listen, view, reflect on and respond to.
  </span>
  <span>
    You can share your response to the music, prompts and visuals in a number of ways.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    Periodically, text prompts will come up in the lower middle of the screen. Underneath the prompts you can select to respond 
    via either writing or drawing depending on what you think is most appropriate. Once you are happy with your response you can 
    click the ‘submit response’ button to share it with others. Above the ‘submit response’ button, you can select the colour palette 
    you will be able to draw responses with, along with options to change the brush size, use an eraser and undo or redo additions to 
    your drawing. 
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    Your responses to these prompts will be completely anonymised and not attributable to you in any way, however during this 
    demonstration we will be capturing a screen recording of the experience.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    You can also use the chat box on the right of the screen to directly speak to others participating. Select a username and 
    click ‘Join Room’ to engage. Be yourself, be someone else, be whomever you want to be!
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    Nine compositions will be presented across the four weeks of room2 async. The music selection will change approximately every three days, while the sun is setting in Narrm — with times set to 'Australian Eastern Standard Time' or GMT+10.
