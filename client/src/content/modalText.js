  This website was produced and is maintained on the unceded territory of the Bunurong Boon Wurrung and Wurundjeri Woi 
  Wurrung peoples of the Eastern Kulin Nation, the Traditional Custodians of the land. We recognise their ongoing legacy 
  of connection to land, waters and culture and pay respect to their Elders past and present. We extend this respect to 
  all other First Nations peoples and Traditional Custodians of this continent, whose land the material pathways that allow 
  our digital connectivity are built upon.

    room2.fm is a digital space for collective reflection, sharing, and vulnerability. For four weeks across the course 
    of <a href="https://bleedonline.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">BLEED</a> room2 will be presenting nine different 
    cycles of music and sound accompanied by a reflective writen prompt and generative graphics. The cycles will change approximately 
    every three days, while the sun is setting in Narrm â€” with times set to 'Australian Eastern Standard Time' or GMT+10, and 
    location and climate info set to the approximate coordinates of Arts House in North Melbourne on Wurundjeri Country.

    While listening to the audio you will be asked to respond to the prompt through either writing or drawing before anonymously 
    submitting it to the room2 server. Once you've shared your own response you will be able to see the previous responses of other
    users.

  <span>
    There is no right or wrong way for you to listen, respond to, or feel a piece of music or sound. We encourage you to 
    trust your ears and intuition and respond sincerely and in whatever way feels true to your experience.
  </span>
  <br />
  <br />
  <span>
    While anonymous the responses will be collected as part of a digital archive which will be online for a longer period than 
    the four weeks of BLEED. The only information we store is the response itself and the time it was submitted.
