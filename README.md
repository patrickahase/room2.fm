# room2.fm

This is my refactoring of the room2 code base to set it up for continued use

# Credits
 - Curtis Jurgensen's custom cursor codepen was really helpful - https://codepen.io/curtisj44/pen/yGxJNX

# To Do For Async
- work out start date for cycle calc
- handle cycle edge cases (more than total cycles)
- set up online server app and replace url in app.js submitResponse
- error handling returning server responses
- collision detection edge cases - too many rerolls, too much text
- change web credits for Bec
- break points for rem

# For meeting 3/8
- text pages
- parameters in
- weather/tidal/moon data on page
- how many intro pages
- updating AOC

- change asynccyclecalc sunset times
- build in tide data to asynccyclecalc

# for integration with Bec
