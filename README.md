# room2.fm

This is my refactoring of the room2 code base to set it up for continued use

# Credits
 - Curtis Jurgensen's custom cursor codepen was really helpful - https://codepen.io/curtisj44/pen/yGxJNX
 - Matthew Jones for his article on state management for undo/redo with fabric = https://exceptionnotfound.net/drawing-with-fabricjs-and-typescript-part-7-undo-redo/

# To Do For Async
- volume noteches to buttons
- set timer to track total ratio?
- change colour while on eraser
