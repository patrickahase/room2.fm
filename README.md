# room2.fm

This is my refactoring of the room2 code base to set it up for continued use

# Credits

# To Do For Async
- volume noteches to buttons
- set timer to track total ratio?
- change colour while on eraser
- work out start date for cycle calc
- handle cycle edge cases (more than total cycles)
- reduncdency on artist info before modal toggle
- set up online server app and replace url in app.js submitResponse
